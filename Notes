Notes:

* Prevent menu entry when TXing - Believe this is done
* Fix up menu display from changes in the u8g2 code (I think?) that shifted things around
* Finish creating menu options
* Implement radio functionality
	* Possibly use darksidelemm/dra818?
		* Quick glance, may need some modifications to fit my needs, worth of commit back?
	* Or... fatpat/arduino-dra818? Fork from above...

* Circuit design (Schematic, physical PCB layout)
* Picking of enclosure
* Research lowpass filter design 
* Research audio/mic opamps
